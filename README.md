# Summer Chores
Utilizes Javascript by having created a list of summer chores to be done as functions, and assign a random number chance of failing, or moving onto the next task. Displays knowledge in use of callback functions, as well as promises. Uses random number generation, and set timeout methods to simulate asynchronus behavior.

How to run:

1. Clone the repository over to your local machine.

2. Open the project in VS Code. 

3. Use the live server extension run the project in your browser.

4. Open your browser's console and view the logged results as the chores run.

5. Refresh the page to retry.

*Optionally, you can replace the name parameter with your own!* 

Refrences: 

Loosely referenced a tutorial from the 'Bro Code' youtube channel on callback functions, their video on promises and their video on async and await functions.
